# Sentiment and thematic analysis from restaurants' client reviews  🍟

This project focuses on **sentiment analysis of customer comments** related to McDonald's restaurants, aiming to provide actionable insights and faster customer feedback handling through data-driven automation and visualization.

## Problem :

### 1. **Volume of Feedback**
- **Challenge**: Thousands of online customer reviews make it hard to get a global view.
- **Solution**:  
  - Automatically collect and classify reviews by **themes** and **sentiments**.
  - Build a **dashboard** to visualize trends without reading every single review.

### 2. **Interpretation Difficulties**
- **Challenges**:
  - How to **identify top sources of customer dissatisfaction**?
  - How to **detect what satisfies customers**?
  - How to **spot misaligned ratings** (e.g. 1 star for a positive comment)?
- **Solution**:
  - Analyze comments using **keywords** and **sentiment scores**.
  - Detect **inconsistencies** between sentiment and given star ratings.

### 3. **Slow or Inappropriate Reactions**
- **Challenge**: How to respond quickly and appropriately to customer feedback?
- **Solution**:  
  - Use **LLMs** to **automatically generate** tailored responses based on sentiment.
